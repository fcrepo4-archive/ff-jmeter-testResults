Fedora Test Results
=====================
Fedora version: 3.6.2 (https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA36/Downloads)  

Test code: https://github.com/futures/ff-jmeter-madness/blob/6e4f37047ab2f99d924d4db8cecd5cca42e141fa/plans/fedora.jmx

The results of the test run are in the [log](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/log/) directory  

The various plots analyzing the test reults are in the [results](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/results/) directory  
  * [StatusOfResponse-1.png](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/results/StatusOfResponse-1.png) shows the different response codes received for an operation, but the count is weighted
  * [StatusOfResponse-2.png](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/results/StatusOfResponse-2.png) shows the different response codes received for an operation, with the actual count

The stats visualizations were done using R (http://www.r-project.org/). The code used to produce the graphs is in [RCode](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/fedora-jmx.r).  

The file [systemInfo.txt](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/systemInfo.txt/) contains information of the system where the tests were run 

The access logs generated by Tomcat have also been uploaded, so as to compare the concurrency of requests generated by Jmeter and those received by Fedora
