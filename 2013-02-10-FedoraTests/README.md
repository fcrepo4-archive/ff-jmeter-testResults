Fedora Test Results
=====================
Fedora version: 3.6.2 (https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA36/Downloads)  

Test code: https://github.com/futures/ff-jmeter-madness/blob/6e4f37047ab2f99d924d4db8cecd5cca42e141fa/plans/fedora.jmx

System info: The file [systemInfo.txt](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/systemInfo.txt/) contains information of the system where the tests were run 

There are two sets of test results, with tests performed on the same VM. 
 * Run1 was performed from the futures1 VM with 2GB of RAM
 * Run2 was performed from the futures1 VM with the RAM increased from 2GB to 4GB and the Java heap size increased to 1GB. 
   * The file [systemInfo-TestHarness.txt](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run2/systemInfo-TestHarness.txt) has the system information for the machine from which the jmeter tests were run


Run1
-----
The results of the test run are in the [log](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run1/log/) directory  

The various plots analyzing the test reults are in the [results](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run1/results/) directory  
 * [StatusOfResponse.png](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run1/results/StatusOfResponse.png) shows a stacked bar chart with the count of the different response codes received for an operation, grouped for each thread count
 * [ThreadCountVsElapsedTime.png](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run1/results/ThreadCountVsElapsedTime.png) shows a box plot of time taken to complete each response for each thread count
 * [ThreadCountVsElapsedTimebyOperation.png](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run1/results/ThreadCountVsElapsedTimebyOperation.png) shows a box plot of time taken to complete each response for each thread count, grouped by type of operation
   * [What is a box plot?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot)

The [access logs](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run1/access-log) generated by Tomcat have also been uploaded, so as to compare the concurrency of requests generated by Jmeter and those received by Fedora


Run2
-----
The results of the test run are in the [log](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run2/log/) directory  

The various plots analyzing the test reults are in the [results](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run2/results/) directory  
 * [StatusOfResponse.png](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run2/results/StatusOfResponse.png) shows the count of the different response codes received for an operation, grouped for each thread count
 * [ThreadCountVsElapsedTime.png](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run2/results/ThreadCountVsElapsedTime.png) shows a box plot of time taken to complete each response for each thread count
 * [ThreadCountVsElapsedTimebyOperation.png](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run2/results/ThreadCountVsElapsedTimebyOperation.png) shows a box plot of time taken to complete each response for each thread count, grouped by type of operation

The file [systemInfo-TestHarness.txt](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/run2/systemInfo-TestHarness.txt) has the system information for the machine from which the jmeter tests were run

About the test
--------------
 * Test code: https://github.com/futures/ff-jmeter-madness/blob/6e4f37047ab2f99d924d4db8cecd5cca42e141fa/plans/fedora.jmx
 * The jmeter tests were extended to perform modifying each datastream 10 times, compared to the jmeter tests from [2013-02-01](/2013-02-01-FedoraTests/).
 * The test was repeated for 
    * a range of file sizes with mean 1B, 1kB, 8kB, 0.1MB, 1MB, 8MB used as data for the datastreams 
    * for different thread counts (concurrent requests performed by Jmeter) - 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 ad 160 threads
 * The test script [fedoraTest.sh](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/fedoraTest.sh) was used to execute the test code with the different test parameters - file size and thread count


Analysing the test results
-----------------------
 * The stats visualizations were done using R (http://www.r-project.org/). 
 * The code used to produce the graphs is in [fedora-jmx.r](/2013-02-10-FedoraTests/fedora-jmx.r).
 * To execute the code, from within R
 > source('/path/to/the/file/fedora-jmx.r')
   * The program will ask you to choose the directory which contains the test results (csv format)
   * It will run through all the files, gather the data and produce 3 graphs and a summary of the data. These will be saved in your current working directory.
